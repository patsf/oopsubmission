// a) Cannot change Test to test as it will cause a compilation error because the class and file name won't match.
// c) Removing quotation mark causes compilation error
// d) Changing main to man causes runtime error as the main method can't be found
// e) printIn is necessary to print text, changing to bogus causes compilation error as it is not a valid command
// f) Causes compilation error as semicolon is needed at the end of the statement
// g) Closing braces are needed therefore removing it causes a compilation error
